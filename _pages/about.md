Welcome to my website. I am a masterâ€™s student in Materials Science and Engineering at Columbia University, doing research under the guidance of Professor [Nanfang Yu](https://www.apam.columbia.edu/faculty/nanfang-yu). I earned my BS in Materials Science and Engineering from Columbia (2022-2024) and my BA in Physics and Japanese from Colgate University (2019-2024). I also gained industry experience as an assistant investment manager intern at Oriental Fortune Capital in 2023, where I focused on market research and investment analysis. 

I am drawn to materials science because of its potential to harness research insights for building tangible creations across various disciplines. Consequently, my interests extend to a variety of topics, so this site is not solely dedicated to engineering. I built this site to provide access to my CV and some of my works. Thanks for stopping by.

My other interests include going to track days (still a newbie), video games, PC & keyboard building, traditional Chinese calligraphy and seal carving, listening to and producing music, Guqin and guitar, Taichi, drawing, and clothing design.

I am always open to new experiences and opportunities, so please reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat. I am looking forward to hearing from you!

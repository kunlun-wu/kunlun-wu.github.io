Welcome — I’m a master’s student in Materials Science and Engineering at Columbia University, conducting research under the guidance of Professor [Nanfang Yu](https://www.apam.columbia.edu/faculty/nanfang-yu). 

My research has centered on optical and electronic behavior in doped oxide nanomaterials and polymer thin films, combining approaches from material science, optics, electrical characterization and computational modeling. I’m especially interested in how material properties can be designed and programmed to create functional, expressive, or interactive physical systems.

I hold a B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from Columbia University and a B.A. in Physics and Japanese from Colgate University. I also completed an internship at Oriental Fortune Capital, where I conducted technology-focused market research and investment analysis, gaining perspective on how research informs practical innovation.

Outside the lab, I like to build and make — from mechanical keyboards and PCs to drawing, calligraphy, seal carving, and Guqin. These activities keep me engaged with materials and making, in ways that parallel my research interests in process and structure.

I’m interested in collaborative environments that connect science, design, and computation, and in exploring materials as a medium for experimentation and design.

  This project, conducted in collaboration with Xinyi Ma, Zhaowen Lin, and Jianing Zhou, investigates small-polaron conduction in copper-doped nanocrystalline ceria (CeO₂).
  Through impedance spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and structural analysis, it examines how Cu incorporation modifies charge-transport behavior and may interact with local defect chemistry, revealing a measurable enhancement in conductivity compared with undoped ceria, suggesting a possible correlation with oxygen-vacancy dynamics previously reported in high-temperature catalytic studies.

I was fortunate to work with Professor Siu-Wai Chan and Xinyi Ma on this project during my senior year and continuing into my master’s studies. I am also grateful for the guidance and support of Professor Simon Billinge and Dr. Adrian Chitu. The pellet pressing was carried out primarily at the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory, and I thank Professor David Walker and Supervisor Echo Shuo for their generous assistance.

The growing demand for functional nanomaterials in energy conversion and sensing has motivated extensive efforts to tailor their electrical behavior through controlled defect and dopant engineering. [Previous studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0920586111006705) from our group on copper-doped nanoceria demonstrated that samples with approximately 8 % Cu exhibited the most favorable catalytic performance at 150-250°C, although the underlying mechanism remained unclear. The present work seeks to provide insight into the charge-transport processes that may contribute to this behavior.

Sample Preparation
-------------------------------
The nanoparticle samples were synthesized via coprecipitation at room temperature (around **25.5 °C**). 
### Reactants
- Cerium(III) nitrate hexahydrate, Ce(NO3)3 ∙ 6H2O: `6.5133g`
- Copper nitrate hexahydrate, Cu(NO3)2 ∙ 2.5H2O: `n ∙ 0.046525g` for n% Cu-CeO₂.
- HMT, hexamethylenetetramine, (CH2)6N4: `28.0372g`
- Deionized water (18 MΩ)

### Synthesis
1. Dissolve the cerium nitrate and HMT in separate beakers, each containing **400mL** deionized water.
2. Add the copper nitrate to the cerium nitrate solution
3. Stir both beakers for **30** **minutes** 
4. Combine the contents of each beaker in and stir for **30** **minutes**
5. Move the mixture to a **40°C** water bath and stir for **3 hours**
6. Remove the mixture from the water bath and stir for **18 hours**

### Centrifugation and Drying
The equipment used is a **Beckman Coulter Avanti J-E centrifuge** at Columbia Biomolecular Characterization Facility with **JA-17 rotor**. The samples were centrifuged at `12500 rmp` for `2 hours` at `4°C`. After centrifugation, excess supernatant was removed and the bottles were placed in a drying bin with aluminum foil cover for **72 hours**.

The dried samples were then ground into fine powders using mortar and pestle.

### Pellet Pressing
The powders were pressed into pellets using a Enerpac hydraulic press at Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory under the guidance of Professor David Walker and Supervisor Echo Shuo.

1. Place the silver housing firmly onto the black housing, and insert the first small cylinder into the chamber 
2. Deposit **0.170g** of powder into the chamber. 
3. Insert the second small cylinder and the long cylinder into the chamber 
4. Bring die to the press, turn the oil valve to the closed position. 
5. Lower the hydraulic arm until it is touching the sample and incrementally increase the pressure to **5000psi**
6. Wait until the pressure drops to around **2000-3000psi** (roughly 20-25 minutes).
7. **Slowly release the pressure** using the valve until the hydraulic arm lifts from the die 
8. Turn the die upside down and place a small acrylic shield around the black housing for pushing out the central cylinders.
9. **Lower the hydraulic arm carefully** until the silver housing **barely makes contact with the press stage**
10. Remove the small cylinder that is now fully exposed and **carefully remove the pellet**
11. Disassemble and thoroughly clean all parts of the die with a Kimwipe and isopropyl alcohol

### Sintering
The heating program performed is as follows:
- ramp 1: `120°C/h`
- level 1: `350°C`
- duration 1: `4h`
- ramp 2: `120°C/h`
- level 2: `0°C` (This will only cool the pellet to room temperature)
- duration 2: `∞`

### Electrode Appllication
<img src='/images/research/1nanoceria/8.jpg'>
1. Using a Q-tip, apply colloidal silver paste (Electron Microscopy 12640) thinly onto the top surface of each pellet
2. Paint a microscope slide with a track of electrode paste for about **2cm** long
3. Let both dry for **2 hours**
4. Apply a dab of Ag paste to one end of the track, flip the pellet and stick the painted side onto the dab
5. Let dry for **2 hours**
6. Cut gold wire into **5cm** long sections. Dip one end of each wire into the Ag paste to improve cohesion with pellet/track
7. Paint the other side of the pellet
8. Dry for **2 hours**
9. Attach the painted ends of the wires to the surface of the pellet and the end of the conductive track using dabs of silver paste.
10. Dry for **24 hours**

Impedance Spectroscopy
-------------------------------
Impedance spectroscopy was performed using an AMETEK SI 1200 impedance spectrometer. The furnace had an improvised faraday cage shielding to reduce noise. A cardboard box with foam inside was used to further insulate the furnace when performing measurements.

### Set Up
1. Place the sample into the box furnace on top a piece of porous ceramic material
2. Snake the ends of each gold wire through the holes in the contacts at the end of each copper wire
3. Connect the two wires to the input ports of the impedance analyzer
4. Turn on the impedance analyzer
5. Turn on the furnace, set the Temp dial to 2.5 times the desired temperature

### Measurement and Data
We collected EIS spectra from 1 MHz to 1 Hz with five loops per sweep, at 50 °C intervals between 50 and 200 °C, for 0–16 % Cu-doped samples (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 %). Data were captured using SMaRT EIS and fitted in ZView with equivalent-circuit models; XRD and PDF analyses were used to interpret structural features. Together, these measurements indicate conductivity enhancement versus undoped ceria and behavior consistent with thermally activated small-polaron hopping. **Quantitative values and model details are included in an in-review manuscript and will be added here following publication.**

  This project, conducted in collaboration with Xinyi Ma, Zhaowen Lin, and Jianing Zhou, investigates small-polaron conduction in copper-doped nanocrystalline ceria (CeO₂).
  Through impedance spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and structural analysis, it examines how Cu incorporation modifies charge-transport behavior and may interact with local defect chemistry, revealing a measurable enhancement in conductivity compared with undoped ceria, suggesting a possible correlation with oxygen-vacancy dynamics previously reported in high-temperature catalytic studies.

I was fortunate to work with Professor Siu-Wai Chan and Xinyi Ma on this project throughout my senior year and into my master's studies. I was fortunate to receive many help from people such as Professor Simon Billinge, Dr. Adrian Chitu, the pellet pressing were done mostly at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, many thanks to Professor David Walker and Supervisor Echo Shuo.

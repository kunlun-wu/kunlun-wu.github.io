  Working with Cheng-Chia Tsai, this project investigates metal-ion doping as a solution-based approach to tune the optical response of SU-8 polymer films.
  Through controlled curing and thermal treatment, it produces uniform, flexible thin films with increased refractive index and subtle color shifts associated with coordination effects.
  Ellipsometric analysis and Lorentzian optical modeling are used to extract optical constants, and a preliminary machine-learning framework is being developed to correlate refractive-index trends as additional data become available.

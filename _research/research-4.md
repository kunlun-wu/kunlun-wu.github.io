  Working with Cheng-Chia Tsai, this project investigates metal-ion doping as a solution-based approach to tune the optical response of SU-8 polymer films.
  Through controlled curing and thermal treatment, it produces uniform, flexible thin films with increased refractive index and subtle color shifts.
  Ellipsometric analysis and Cauchy/Lorentzian optical modeling are used to extract optical constants, and a preliminary machine-learning framework is being developed to correlate refractive-index trends as additional data become available.

This project was conducted in collaboration with Cheng-Chia Tsai under the supervision of Professor [Nanfang Yu](https://www.apam.columbia.edu/faculty/nanfang-yu). It builds upon my previous project ([Refractive Index Enhancement of Polymer Thin Film using CeO₂ Nanoparticles](https://kunlun-wu.github.io/research/research-2/)) on nanoparticle-doped polymer thin films by exploring metal-ion doping as an alternative strategy to enhance the refractive index of SU-8 polymer films for photonic and optical-coating applications. 

The motivation for this project stems from the challenges encountered in achieving uniform nanoparticle dispersion within the polymer matrix, which can lead to film inhomogeneity and optical scattering. Metal-ion doping offers a potentially simpler and more controllable approach to modifying the optical properties of the polymer without the complications associated with nanoparticle aggregation.

Sample Preparation
-------------------------------
The metal-ion doped SU-8 thin films were fabricated using a solution-based approach. Instead of incorporating nanoparticles, metal salts were directly dissolved into the SU-8 precursor solution to achieve doping with cerium (Ce), copper (Cu), and titanium (Ti) ions.
